# HIS-and-EHR-System-for-University-Health-Centre

The system of the Patient Journey Cycle installed in VIT is that when the student faces a problem, the patient tells the security guard of hostel block to call the ambulance. The ambulance comes and the patient is taken to the Health Center. The patient then gives his ID card for a registration and the fee of which he has to pay initially. The patient is given a booklet in which the doctor enters the symptoms, the predicted tests and the medication which has to be later purchased by the pharmacy. However, first the vitals of the patient are taken by the nurse at the health center. Then only the patient is sent to the doctor. Our software aims to digitize the entire solution. All the stages of the cycle will be executed on a website and an android application. The best possible way for the patient to visit a health center and make his visit and his overall experience of treatment much simpler and more likable. The project aims to create a web portal in order to make the hospital management system digitized. We have created a survey in order to check the main important portals which will be the most useful for the patients and the portals which the patients found would benefit the hospital in the best possible way.
